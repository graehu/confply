# Confply #

A way to run commandline tools abstractly.

currently supports:

* c++ compilers. (only clang on linux atm)
* nothing else because it's very early days.

## Reason this exists?  ##

I'm just getting tired of complicated build systems when I just want to compile some files or add a build event and have it work crossplatform.
This is basically just a python module that runs python scripts to build configs that run tools.

**Not fit for human consumption**
